            In the first stage of the project we perused the web for reputable sources that had interesting and powerful data. 
            We decided to go with education data from UNICEF because given we are all college educated, we wanted to know about 
            education disparities around the world. We also thought this was a good data set because it gave us a lot of information 
            that we could compare across and hopefully find some useful insights. Since the dataset had so much info, we decided to 
            focus on the least developed countries, and filtered out those which were not qualified as such, or had missing data.

                    In the first graph we answer the questions: What are the least developed countries? What qualifies the least developed countries 
                    and what regions are they located in? Through the graph we can see least developed countries locations and their corresponding 
                    regions indicated by color. Read the caption to see how UNICEF classifies the least developed countries. We see the least developed 
                    countries are concentrated in Africa and Asia, mostly Eastern and South Africa and West and Central Africa by region. 
                    From our previous knowledge about the developing world this was expected. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the second graph we answer the question: What are the school completion rates in these countries? Which regions have the highest/lowest school 
                    completion rates? What is the average school completion rate in these countries? To answer these questions we created a barchart that 
                    length encodes the school completion rate in each country. Each bar is then color-coded based on the country’s region and then sorted so we 
                    can see the statistics compared to the rest of the countries in that region. We have also included annotations to show the lowest school completion 
                    rate belonging to the country of South Sudan located in the region of Eastern and Southern Africa. The highest school completion rate out of the 
                    least developed countries is Sao Tome and Principe located in the region of West and Central Africa. This was interesting to us since most of the 
                    least developed countries are concentrated in these two regions I would not have guessed the highest school completion rate would be in this area. 
                    We would’ve assumed it would be in an area more surrounded by not developing countries. However, on inspection of the map I saw that Sao Tome and 
                    Principe is an island off the west coast of Africa. This made us think that maybe the isolation of an island keeps Sao Tome and Principe away from 
                    the conflict and negative environment in Central Africa that could affect school completion. Regional averages are also shown with the lowest regional 
                    average in West and Central Africa and the highest in East Asia and Pacific.

                    In this topic, we wanted to explore the differences in primary school completion rates between men and women in the Least Developed Countries (LDC). 
                    As there are clear correlations between the growing equal rights of women and higher developed countries, looking at the disparities between education 
                    rates between men and women would allow us to see if they have a high education completion rate in general or if it’s a country where men have a 
                    proportionally higher opportunity to have an education. <br>
                    In both graphs we have the completion rates for women and men in the Least Developed Countries. Looking strictly at the averages, men were slightly higher 
                    at 56.031% vs women at 54.875%. This doesn’t seem very significant at first with a less than 1.5% difference; however, looking closer at the data the 
                    standard deviations between the two have a slightly higher variation with men at 16.31 and 21.04 for women. This is explained by the deviation of rates 
                    between men and women at the extremes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The countries like Sao Tome and Principe that have high completion rates for both men and women at 90% and 86% and Myanmar at 84% for men and 78% for women, 
                    the countries with the lowest completion rates have a much higher difference between men and women. South Sudan is the lowest for both men and women, but the 
                    clear difference is that women's rates are nearly half of that of the men’s at 18% to 30%.<br>
                    Implications for this is that while the countries with higher rates of education have small differences between men and women’s completion rates, the countries 
                    with the lowest rates of education have significantly higher differences. This follows the correlations between low education rates and high education opportunity 
                    difference for gender. Ultimately though, amongst the least developed countries there are only significant gender discrepancies amongst the lowest of those countries.

                    In this topic, we sought to compare primary school completion rates in rural versus urban areas within each region. 
                    In order to properly evaluate these differences, we created a graph calculating the completion rate of urban areas 
                    subtracted from that of rural areas. Then, the table encoded the bars displaying these differences within each country 
                    with colors indicating the country’s region. The bars were ordered according to the difference value. Clusters of bars 
                    along the ordered The bar graph allowed us to investigate whether larger bars were encoded in a majority in color. 
                    This would inform us whether countries in a certain region had greater completion rate differences between urban and rural areas. 
                    After creating this visualization, it became clear that the SSA region, or Sub-Saharan African region, encompassed the countries 
                    with the greatest difference in completion rates between urban and rural areas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also created a map displaying the rural versus urban completion rates. The map was encoded with a diverging color 
                    scale moving from blue to yellow to red. Countries encoded in blue represented countries with greater urban completion 
                    rates than rural areas while red encoded the opposite. Luminance represented the extent of difference. Yellow indicated countries 
                    with marginal differences in completion rates between rural and urban areas. With this encoding, the map made it clear that, 
                    globally, there were no significant completion rate differences where urban areas were lower than rural areas. By contrast, 
                    the map showed there were many significant completion rate differences with urban areas exceeding that or rural areas. 
                    This is seen by the amount of blue on the map and lack of red. On top of this, the map supported data displayed in the table by 
                    showing a concentration of blue countries in Africa and the greatest disparity occuring in the African country Gabon, with urban 
                    exceeding rural completion rates 43.7 more.

                    This information continues our story of related issues to the primary school completion rate gaps in Least Developed Countries. 
                    Since we have concluded that many of the Least Developed Countries are in Africa, we have also concluded in this topic that many 
                    countries in the Sub-Saharan African region  have the greatest gaps between urban and rural school completion rates. Further, we 
                    discovered amongst these gaps, urban areas outperform rural areas in school completion rates while the opposite is almost never true. 
                    These great education disparities between urban and rural areas in majority African countries provide insight into not only the overall 
                    low primary school completion rates in African Least Developed Countries, but also the issue of distribution and access to education.

                In what way is wealth class and school completion rate correlated? 
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                To find a pattern between class and completion rate, a line graph was drawn to detect any possible correlation. Instead of using time as the x-axis variable, 
                I used the five different wealth classes. Even before visualizing this data, it is obvious that the higher the wealth class, the higher the school completion rate. 
                The next question is to ask, how wide is the discrepancy between wealth classes? A line graph visualization was chosen because the slope is an easy visualization to observe. 
                A wider discrepancy is indicated by a drastic slope in the line graph. Flatter lines indicate a narrower discrepancy between completion rates and wealth class. 
                From the visualization, it seemed that the slopes were similar across different countries, indicating that the completion rate discrepancies were also similar. 
                Another comparison could be made between the different countries. For example, although there are discrepancies, there is also a general difference between the countries of all classes. 
                Some countries’ poor classes have higher school completion rates than the richest class of another country. For example, South Sudan’s richest class have a school completion rate 
                of about 45%, while the poorest class of neighboring Sudan have about 49% school completion rate. The range of completion rates can differ drastically depending on the country.

                In which countries does the poorest class have the highest school rate?
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                Because most people are likely to belong in the poorest class, they are also in most need of education. How does the poorest class between different countries compare in school completion rate? 
                For this, a bar graph was created to compare the completion rates in the poorest class. The bars were color coded to indicate which subregion the country is in. The next question that came from 
                this bar graph is whether there is a correlation between the school completion rate and the geography. By clicking on a specific region, the bars within that region will be highlighted. 
                It can be seen that some regions do generally better than other regions. For example, South Asia has higher completion rates than does Eastern and Southern Africa. This raises another question; 
                do countries near each other experience around the same level of the completion rates?
